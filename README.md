# Evaluating-impacts-of-a-cartel
In this repository I use a difference-in-differences model and CPI data to estimate the effect on prices of the alleged bread Cartel that operated in Canada from 2002 to 2016. 
I also talk about some of the issues with using a difference in difference model for this type of problem and talk about the competition bureaus immunity policy and why it works.
